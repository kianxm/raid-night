# Contracts

The shared shapes every agent builds against. Source files are the truth; this page explains
the why. Update it in the same commit as any contract change.

## Files

| File | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Shared/Types.luau` | Every persisted and shared type |
| `src/Shared/Net.luau` | Remote names, payloads, rate limits |
| `src/Shared/Config.luau` | Every tuning knob |
| `src/Shared/Data/Critters.luau` | Species ids and stats (ids are permanent) |

## Persisted data

| Key | Type | Written by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile per user | `PlayerProfile` | DataService only (session-locked) | Others send messages |
| Snapshot per user | `DenSnapshot` | SnapshotService | Never includes vault critters |
| Escrow per raidId | `EscrowRecord` | EscrowService | Write-once create, then state moves forward only |

## Money model

- `stored`: Glow in the den. Accrues lazily. Stealable (25% per raid, capped by what is there).
- `glow`: banked Glow. Never stealable. Loot lands here (safe once home).
- Always `Economy.accrue` before changing placements or den level.

## Escrow

```
Pending ──debitDefender + markDebited──▶ Debited ──creditRaider + markCommitted──▶ Committed
   └──void (before any debit)──▶ Voided
```

Each arrow is two single-key writes; every step is idempotent by `raidId`
(`appliedTransfers` on each profile). Invariants, enforced by
`tests/specs/EscrowSimulation.spec.luau`:

1. A critter uid exists in exactly one place: one profile, or in flight for one raid.
2. Glow is conserved.
3. Repeating any step changes nothing after the first success.
4. No defender loses more than `Config.Limits.maxLossesPerDay` critters per UTC day.

If you change `Escrow.luau`, `RaidRules.recordIncoming` or anything in `appliedTransfers`, the
simulation must still pass, and the `reviewer` agent must sign off.

## Schema changes

1. Add the field with a default in `Profile.new`.
2. Add `migrations[n]` in `Profile.luau` and bump `Config.SCHEMA_VERSION`.
3. Add a test that migrates an old-shape profile.
4. Never remove or rename a persisted field without a migration.

# Contracts

The shared shapes every agent builds against. Source files are the truth; this page explains
the why. Update it in the same commit as any contract change.

## Files

| File | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Shared/Types.luau` | Every persisted and shared type |
| `src/Shared/Net.luau` | Remote names, payloads, rate limits |
| `src/Shared/Config.luau` | Every tuning knob |
| `src/Shared/Data/Critters.luau` | Species ids and stats (ids are permanent) |

## Persisted data

| Key | Type | Written by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile per user | `PlayerProfile` | DataService only (session-locked) | Others send messages |
| Snapshot per user | `DenSnapshot` | SnapshotService | Never includes vault critters |
| Escrow per raidId | `EscrowRecord` | EscrowService | Write-once create, then state moves forward only |

## Money model

- `stored`: Glow in the den. Accrues lazily. Stealable (25% per raid, capped by what is there).
- `glow`: banked Glow. Never stealable. Loot lands here (safe once home).
- Always `Economy.accrue` before changing placements or den level.

## Escrow

```
Pending ──debitDefender + markDebited──▶ Debited ──creditRaider + markCommitted──▶ Committed
   └──void (before any debit)──▶ Voided
```

Each arrow is two single-key writes; every step is idempotent by `raidId`
(`appliedTransfers` on each profile). Invariants, enforced by
`tests/specs/EscrowSimulation.spec.luau`:

1. A critter uid exists in exactly one place: one profile, or in flight for one raid.
2. Glow is conserved.
3. Repeating any step changes nothing after the first success.
4. No defender loses more than `Config.Limits.maxLossesPerDay` critters per UTC day.

If you change `Escrow.luau`, `RaidRules.recordIncoming` or anything in `appliedTransfers`, the
simulation must still pass, and the `reviewer` agent must sign off.

## Kill switches

`Config.Flags` holds one boolean per feature. `false` turns the feature off everywhere. Services
read `Config.Flags.<name>` directly and check it before acting on a request.

| Flag | Gates | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `raids` | Live stealing (RaidService) and new `Live` escrow transfers | `true` |
| `asyncRaids` | Offline raids in pocket dens and new `Async` escrow transfers | `false` |
| `purchases` | Robux products (PurchaseService) | `false` |
| `trading` | Trading (post-launch) | `false` |
| `notifications` | Experience notifications (NotificationService) | `false` |

Defaults turn on only the features that exist. Escrow recovery is never gated: records already
in `Pending` or `Debited` always advance, so turning a flag off cannot strand loot in flight.
Adding a flag is a contract change.

## Schema changes

1. Add the field with a default in `Profile.new`.
2. Add `migrations[n]` in `Profile.luau` and bump `Config.SCHEMA_VERSION`.
3. Add a test that migrates an old-shape profile.
4. Never remove or rename a persisted field without a migration.

## Live raids

Live stealing happens in an online owner's den (RaidService, decision D-003). Tuning lives in
`Config.LiveRaid`:

| Key | Launch value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lockdownSeconds` | 45 | How long a Lockdown lasts |
| `lockdownCooldownSeconds` | 120 | Wait after a Lockdown ENDS before the owner can start another |
| `tagRange` | 6 | Studs: how close the owner must be to tag a raider |
| `grabHoldSeconds` | 1 | How long a raider holds the grab to pick a critter up |

`Net.Requests.Lockdown` is `() -> boolean` (true if a Lockdown started), limited by
`Net.Limits.Lockdown` (3 per 10 s). Lockdown rules:

- Only the den's owner can start one, and it applies to live raids only.
- It blocks ENTRY only. Raiders already inside can leave, but a carried critter drops at the
  border.
- The cooldown counts from the END of a Lockdown (decision D-011). For a Lockdown started at
  server time `start`: `LockdownUntil = start + lockdownSeconds` (when it ends) and
  `LockdownReadyAt = LockdownUntil + lockdownCooldownSeconds` (the earliest the owner can start
  the next one). A den is locked at most 45 s in every 165 s.
- Duration and cooldown are enforced server-side from the server's own state. The client only
  asks; `LockdownUntil` and `LockdownReadyAt` below are for display.

## Replicated attributes

Attributes the server sets on Instances so clients can draw state without a remote. All are
server-written and display-only:

- The server keeps the authoritative state in its own tables. It never reads `CarryingUid`,
  `CarryingSpecies`, `LockdownUntil` or `LockdownReadyAt`, and no server decision ever comes
  from an attribute.
- Clients must never be trusted for them. A client can change an attribute locally; the change
  does not replicate and must never matter.
- Times are server time from `workspace:GetServerTimeNow()`, so every client reads one clock.

| Instance | Attribute | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Player | `Plot` | number | Plot index of the player's den; absent when they have none |
| Player | `CarryingUid` | string | uid of the critter being carried; `""` (or absent) when not carrying |
| Player | `CarryingSpecies` | string | Species id of that critter; `""` (or absent) when not carrying |
| Den Model `Den<plot>` | `Plot` | number | The den's plot index |
| Den Model | `OwnerUserId` | number | Owner's userId; 0 when unowned |
| Den Model | `LockdownUntil` | number | When the current Lockdown ends; absent or past = none active |
| Den Model | `LockdownReadyAt` | number | When the owner can start the next Lockdown; absent or past = ready |
| Pad Part | `PadIndex` | number | The pad's number |
| Critter Model | `CritterUid`, `SpeciesId`, `Tier` | string | Which critter this model draws |
| Critter Model | `PadIndex`, `OwnerUserId` | number | Where it sits and whose it is |

One existing read: IncomeService reads `CritterUid` and `PadIndex` back from critter models it
built itself, only to decide what to redraw. Clients cannot change those values on the server.

## Eggs

`Config.Economy.eggMaxTier` (`"Uncommon"` at launch) is the highest tier a bought egg can hatch.
Tiers up to it keep their `Config.EggOdds` ratios, renormalized to sum to 1
(`Economy.rollTierUpTo`): Common 0.6875 and Uncommon 0.3125 today, tested in `Config.spec`.
Phase 2 raises it to `"Mythic"`. The rescue egg rolls from its own Common-only table and ignores
`eggMaxTier` (decision D-004).

## Tradeability

`Critter.untradeable: boolean?` (decision D-005) marks a critter that can never be traded or
gifted, such as one from a rescue egg. Missing means tradeable, so this optional field needed no
migration and no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump; `Profile.spec` checks that an old save reads as
tradeable.

- `Profile.isTradeable(critter, now)` is the one check: false if `untradeable` is set, or while
  `stolenLockUntil` is in the future.
- Any future trading or gifting code must refuse a critter for which `Profile.isTradeable` is
  false. The `reviewer` checks for this on every trading or gifting PR.
- Raids are not trades: escrow moves an untradeable critter like any other, and the flag survives
  the transfer (tested in `Profile.spec`).
